\section{Introduction}

\LaTeX\ features for typesetting mathematics make it a compelling choice for writing technical documents. This article shows the most basic commands needed to get started with writing math using \LaTeX.


\section{Displaying Mathematics}
\LaTeX\ allows two writing modes for mathematical expressions


\subsection{Inline mode}

inline math mode is used to write formulas that are part of a paragraph. we are going to insert a mathematical equation inline here using a pair of \$ signs: $ E = mc^2 $


\subsection{Display mode}
display math mode is used to write expressions that are not part of a paragraph, and are therefore put on separate lines.
\begin{equation}
	E = mc^2
\end{equation}


\begin{equation*}
	E = mc^2
	
\end{equation*}

Alternative method

\[
	E = mc^2
\]
